# Messing_With_Ciphers

## Premise ##
* Having just taken crypto, I wanted to mess around with the fundamentals a little bit by making my own code to implement the Caesar and Affine ciphers.
* I also don't have very much GUI or C# experience, so I wanted to try and do this project in C# and use WPF

## Packages Used 
I used the NetSpell package that I installed through NuGet
